Archive multiple completed changes in a single operation.

This skill allows you to batch-archive changes, handling spec conflicts intelligently by checking the codebase to determine what's actually implemented.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `view`). Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: None required (prompts for selection)

**Steps**

1. **Get active changes**

   Run `openspec list --json` to get all active changes.

   If no active changes exist, inform user and stop.

2. **Prompt for change selection**

   Ask the user to choose changes (multi-select):
   - Show each change with its schema
   - Include an option for "All changes"
   - Allow any number of selections (1+ works, 2+ is the typical use case)

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT auto-select. Always let the user choose.

   **Load current archive inputs once for the selected root before batch validation:**

   Choose one selected change from this root and run
   `openspec instructions archive --change "<selected-change>" --json` with the
   same selected-root flags. This lookup is advisory and optional: it only supplies
   extra prompt inputs, so it must never block the batch. If it fails or returns
   invalid JSON — for example on an older CLI that does not support this command
   yet — continue the batch with no context and no operation guidance. Do not
   report an error and do not stop.

   A valid response may omit `context` and `operationGuidance`. Treat
   `context` as a required prompt-level input across the batch: read and consider
   it, and apply relevant project facts, conventions, and constraints. Treat
   `operationGuidance` as optional additive advice: read and consider every
   entry, and follow entries that are applicable and compatible with the built-in
   batch workflow.

   Keep both fields separate from conflict analysis, explicit user choices,
   resolved paths, CLI checks, and command contracts. If context conflicts with one
   of those controlling inputs, report the conflict and preserve the controlling
   value. If guidance is inapplicable or conflicts with a controlling input, do not
   follow it and explain why. Do not infer skipped prompts, replacement paths, or
   flags from either field, and do not copy their text verbatim into specs, changes,
   or summaries. These are prompt-level behavior contracts, not enforceable checks.

3. **Batch validation - gather status for all selected changes**

   For each selected change, collect:

   a. **Artifact status** - Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Parse `schemaName`, `artifacts`, `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`
      - Note which artifacts are `done` vs other states

   b. **Task completion** - Read `artifactPaths.tasks.existingOutputPaths` from status JSON
      - Count `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete)
      - If no tasks file exists, note as "No tasks"

   c. **Delta specs** - Check `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` from status JSON
      - List which capability specs exist
      - For each, extract requirement names (lines matching `### Requirement: <name>`)
      - Treat this list as the only delta-spec source. If the `specs` entry is
        missing or the list is empty, perform no spec sync or specs-instruction
        lookup for that change; do not infer deltas from unrelated artifacts.
      - Evaluate this independently for every change, including mixed-schema
        batches where some schemas have no `specs` artifact.
4. **Detect spec conflicts**

   Build a map of `capability -> [changes that touch it]`:

   ```text
   auth -> [change-a, change-b]  <- CONFLICT (2+ changes)
   api  -> [change-c]            <- OK (only 1 change)
   ```

   A conflict exists when 2+ selected changes have delta specs for the same capability.

5. **Resolve conflicts agentically**

   **For each conflict**, investigate the codebase:

   a. **Read the delta specs** from each conflicting change to understand what each claims to add/modify

   b. **Search the codebase** for implementation evidence:
      - Look for code implementing requirements from each delta spec
      - Check for related files, functions, or tests

   c. **Determine resolution**:
      - If only one change is actually implemented -> sync that one's specs
      - If both implemented -> apply in chronological order (older first, newer overwrites)
      - If neither implemented -> skip spec sync, warn user

   d. **Record resolution** for each conflict:
      - Which change's specs to apply
      - In what order (if both)
      - Rationale (what was found in codebase)

6. **Show consolidated status table**

   Display a table summarizing all changes:

   ```markdown
   | Change              | Artifacts | Tasks | Specs   | Conflicts | Status |
   |---------------------|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
   | schema-management   | Done      | 5/5   | 2 delta | None      | Ready  |
   | project-config      | Done      | 3/3   | 1 delta | None      | Ready  |
   | add-oauth           | Done      | 4/4   | 1 delta | auth (!)  | Ready* |
   | add-verify-skill    | 1 left    | 2/5   | None    | None      | Warn   |
   ```

   For conflicts, show the resolution:
   ```text
   * Conflict resolution:
     - auth spec: Will apply add-oauth then add-jwt (both implemented, chronological order)
   ```

   For incomplete changes, show warnings:
   ```text
   Warnings:
   - add-verify-skill: 1 incomplete artifact, 3 incomplete tasks
   ```

7. **Confirm batch operation**

   Ask the user a single confirmation question:

   - "Archive N changes?" with options based on status
   - Options might include:
     - "Archive all N changes"
     - "Archive only N ready changes (skip incomplete)"
     - "Cancel"

   If there are incomplete changes, make clear they'll be archived with warnings.

   Route on the answer by intent, not by exact label — you wrote these labels,
   so match what the user picked rather than the wording above:
   - "Cancel" — stop, do not archive. Report that nothing was archived and skip the remaining steps.
   - The archive-everything option — proceed with every selected change
   - The ready-only option — proceed with only the changes the step 6 table marks `Ready` or `Ready*`, and record the rest as Skipped in step 8c. If a `Ready*` change's conflict partner is skipped, re-derive that conflict's resolution using only the changes being archived.
   - Anything else — ask again rather than archiving

   Before step 8 writes the first main spec or moves any change, fetch every
   required specs-rule snapshot for the confirmed batch. For each change that will
   sync concrete `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths`, run
   `openspec instructions specs --change "<name>" --json` exactly once with the
   same selected-root flags. Obtain all snapshots before the first write or move.
   If any lookup exits non-zero or returns invalid artifact-instruction JSON,
   identify the affected change, report the error, and stop the whole batch before
   any main-spec write or change move. Do not treat lookup failure as omitted
   rules. A valid response without `rules` is the no-rules case.

8. **Execute archive for each confirmed change**

   Process changes in the determined order (respecting conflict resolution):

   a. **Sync specs** if delta specs exist:
      - Use the openspec-sync-specs approach (agent-driven intelligent merge)
      - For conflicts, apply in resolved order
      - Pass that change's fetched specs-rule snapshot into inline sync; inline
        sync must reuse it without fetching instructions again
      - Apply artifact rules only to main specs produced by that change. They do
        not change conflict resolution, archive behavior, or CLI contracts, and
        their text is not copied into an output file
      - Track if sync was done

   b. **Perform the archive**:

      Target name: use the change name as-is when it already starts with a `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix; otherwise prepend the current date as `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>` (same rule as `openspec archive`).

      ```bash
      mkdir -p "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive"
      mv "<changeRoot>" "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive/<target-name>"
      ```

   c. **Track outcome** for each change:
      - Success: archived successfully
      - Failed: error during archive (record error)
      - Skipped: user chose not to archive (if applicable)

9. **Display summary**

   Show final results:

   ```markdown
   ## Bulk Archive Complete

   Archived 3 changes:
   - schema-management-cli -> archive/2026-01-19-schema-management-cli/
   - project-config -> archive/2026-01-19-project-config/
   - add-oauth -> archive/2026-01-19-add-oauth/

   Skipped 1 change:
   - add-verify-skill (user chose not to archive incomplete)

   Spec sync summary:
   - 4 delta specs synced to main specs
   - 1 conflict resolved (auth: applied both in chronological order)
   ```

   If any failures:
   ```text
   Failed 1 change:
   - some-change: Archive directory already exists
   ```

**Conflict Resolution Examples**

Example 1: Only one implemented
```text
Conflict: specs/auth/spec.md touched by [add-oauth, add-jwt]

Checking add-oauth:
- Delta adds "OAuth Provider Integration" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/auth/oauth.ts implementing OAuth flow

Checking add-jwt:
- Delta adds "JWT Token Handling" requirement
- Searching codebase... no JWT implementation found

Resolution: Only add-oauth is implemented. Will sync add-oauth specs only.
```

Example 2: Both implemented
```text
Conflict: specs/api/spec.md touched by [add-rest-api, add-graphql]

Checking add-rest-api (created 2026-01-10):
- Delta adds "REST Endpoints" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/rest.ts

Checking add-graphql (created 2026-01-15):
- Delta adds "GraphQL Schema" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/graphql.ts

Resolution: Both implemented. Will apply add-rest-api specs first,
then add-graphql specs (chronological order, newer takes precedence).
```

**Output On Success**

```markdown
## Bulk Archive Complete

Archived N changes:
- <change-1> -> archive/<target-name-1>/
- <change-2> -> archive/<target-name-2>/

Spec sync summary:
- N delta specs synced to main specs
- No conflicts (or: M conflicts resolved)
```

**Output On Partial Success**

```markdown
## Bulk Archive Complete (partial)

Archived N changes:
- <change-1> -> archive/<target-name-1>/

Skipped M changes:
- <change-2> (user chose not to archive incomplete)

Failed K changes:
- <change-3>: Archive directory already exists
```

**Output When No Changes**

```markdown
## No Changes to Archive

No active changes found. Create a new change to get started.
```

**Guardrails**
- Allow any number of changes (1+ is fine, 2+ is the typical use case)
- Always prompt for selection, never auto-select
- Detect spec conflicts early and resolve by checking codebase
- When both changes are implemented, apply specs in chronological order
- Skip spec sync only when implementation is missing (warn user)
- Show clear per-change status before confirming
- Use single confirmation for entire batch
- Never archive after the user cancels the confirmation — a cancelled batch archives nothing
- Track and report all outcomes (success/skip/fail)
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive
- Archive directory target uses current date: YYYY-MM-DD-<name>; a name that already starts with a `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix is used as-is (never stack a second date)
- If archive target exists, fail that change but continue with others
- Fetch archive inputs once per selected root before spec inspection or moves
- Fetch all required specs-rule snapshots before the batch's first main-spec write or move
- A failed archive-inputs lookup never blocks the batch; it proceeds with no context or guidance
- A failed specs instruction lookup stops the whole batch atomically
- Changes without concrete `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` continue without spec sync
- Apply relevant runtime context across the batch and report conflicts
- Operation guidance remains advisory; consider every entry and explain rejected advice
- Keep runtime inputs, conflict analysis, CLI-derived values, and artifact rules separate
- Artifact rules constrain only written specs
- Never copy runtime input or artifact-rule text verbatim into output files
